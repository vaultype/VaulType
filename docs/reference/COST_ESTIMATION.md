## Overview

VaulType's **local-only architecture** dramatically reduces operational costs compared to cloud-based alternatives. There are no server costs, no API usage fees, and no scaling concerns. The primary costs are development time, Apple Developer Program fees, and CI/CD infrastructure.

## Infrastructure Costs

### Apple Developer Program

| Item | Cost | Frequency | Required |
|------|------|-----------|----------|
| Apple Developer Program | $99 | Annual | Yes (for code signing & notarization) |

Without this, you cannot:
- Code sign with Developer ID
- Notarize the app (Gatekeeper will block it)
- Distribute outside the App Store

### CI/CD — GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions provides free minutes for public repositories:

| Plan | Minutes/Month | Cost |
|------|--------------|------|
| Free (public repo) | 2,000 | $0 |
| Free (private repo) | 2,000 | $0 |
| Team | 3,000 | $4/user/month |

**Estimated usage per month:**

| Workflow | Runs/Month | Minutes/Run | Total Minutes |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Build (push/PR) | 60 | 5 | 300 |
| Test (push/PR) | 60 | 10 | 600 |
| Release | 2 | 20 | 40 |
| Nightly | 30 | 15 | 450 |
| **Total** | | | **~1,390** |

> 💡 For a public repo, this fits within the free tier. macOS runners consume minutes at a 10x rate on the free plan, so actual billed minutes = ~139 standard minutes.

**If exceeding free tier:**

| Overage | Rate |
|---------|------|
| macOS minutes | $0.08/minute |
| Estimated monthly overage | $0-30 |

### Domain & Hosting

| Item | Cost | Frequency |
|------|------|-----------|
| Domain (vaultype.app) | $14-20 | Annual |
| GitHub Pages (website + appcast) | $0 | Free |
| Alternative: Netlify/Vercel | $0 | Free tier |

### Model Hosting

Models are hosted on Hugging Face (free) and downloaded by users directly. No bandwidth costs for us.

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Hugging Face model hosting | $0 (public models) |
| GitHub Releases (DMG hosting) | $0 (within repo limits) |

---

## Recurring Costs

### Monthly

| Item | Low | High | Notes |
|------|-----|------|-------|
| GitHub Actions (if private repo) | $0 | $30 | Free for public repos |
| **Monthly Total** | **$0** | **$30** | |

### Annual

| Item | Cost |
|------|------|
| Apple Developer Program | $99 |
| Domain name | $14-20 |
| GitHub (if private/Team) | $0-$48 |
| **Annual Total** | **$113-$167** |

---

## One-Time Costs

| Item | Cost | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Development hardware (Mac) | $0-$3,000 | Assuming dev already has one |
| External microphone for testing | $50-200 | Optional but recommended |
| Apple Developer enrollment | $99 | First year |
| create-dmg (Homebrew) | $0 | Open source |
| SwiftLint (Homebrew) | $0 | Open source |
| **One-Time Total** | **$99-$3,299** | |

---

## Total Cost Summary

### Year 1 (Development + Launch)

| Category | Low Estimate | High Estimate |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Apple Developer Program | $99 | $99 |
| Domain | $14 | $20 |
| CI/CD | $0 | $360 |
| Hardware | $0 | $3,000 |
| External services | $0 | $0 |
| Cloud/server costs | **$0** | **$0** |
| **Year 1 Total** | **$113** | **$3,479** |

### Ongoing Annual (Year 2+)

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| Apple Developer Program | $99 |
| Domain | $14-20 |
| CI/CD | $0-360 |
| Cloud/server costs | **$0** |
| **Annual Total** | **$113-$479** |

### Cost per User

Since VaulType has no server costs, the cost per user is effectively **$0** at any scale. Whether 10 users or 100,000 users, the infrastructure cost remains the same.

## Cost Comparison with Alternatives

### Building a Cloud-Based Alternative

If VaulType used cloud speech recognition and LLM APIs instead:

| Service | Cost | Volume |
|---------|------|--------|
| OpenAI Whisper API | $0.006/min | Per audio minute |
| OpenAI GPT-4o-mini | $0.15/1M tokens | Per processed text |
| Server hosting (AWS) | $50-500/month | Depending on scale |
| **Monthly (1,000 active users)** | **$200-2,000** | |

**VaulType's local approach eliminates all of these costs.**

### User Cost Comparison

| Product | User Cost | Model |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| VaulType | **Free** | Open source, local AI |
| Superwhisper | $10/month ($120/yr) | Subscription |
| VoiceInk | $30 one-time | Proprietary |
| MacWhisper Pro | $30 one-time | Proprietary |
| Apple Dictation | Free (with macOS) | Cloud-dependent |

### Developer Program ROI

At $99/year for the Apple Developer Program, the break-even vs. alternatives:

| Alternative | Annual Cost (User) | Users Needed to Match $99 |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Superwhisper | $120/user/yr | < 1 user |
| Cloud Whisper API | ~$7/user/yr | ~14 users |

Even one person using VaulType instead of a paid alternative saves more than the Developer Program fee.

## Optional Costs

These are not required but may improve the project:

| Item | Cost | Benefit |
|------|------|---------|
| Sentry crash reporting | $0-26/month | Opt-in crash reports from users |
| Figma (design) | $0-15/month | UI/UX design tool |
| TestFlight (beta testing) | $0 | Included with Apple Developer |
| Localization service | $0.05-0.10/word | Professional translation |
| Security audit | $5,000-20,000 | Third-party code audit |
| Legal review | $500-2,000 | License and privacy policy review |
